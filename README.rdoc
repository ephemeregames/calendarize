== Calendarize

A easy-to-use calendar helper for your rails projects. Currently supports a weekly and daily calendar.


== Getting Started

1. Add this gem in your *Gemfile* :

    gem 'calendarize'

2. Add an entry in *app/assets/javascripts/application.js* :

    //= require calendarize

3. Add this class method to any *controller* that will have a calendar in it's views :

    class MyController < ApplicationController
      calendarize
    end

4. Add this class method to any *model* that will represent an event in the calendar

    class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
      acts_as_event
    end


== Example

Here is an example of how to use the calenderize helpers in your views. If you put *calendarize* in your controller, it gives you the *@calendar* variable. Also, in this example I added *acts_as_event* to my model *Event* so I have the scope *for_day*.

    = daily_calendar @calendar[:date], Event.for_day(@calendar[:date]), verbose: @calendar[:verbose] do |c|
      = l(c.event.start_time, format: :short)
      = ' - '
      = l(c.event.end_time, format: :short)
      = ' : '
      = c.event.title
